# DESCRIPTION

Product Mix Optimization using Linear Programming

üìå Abstract:
In a competitive industrial environment, making smart decisions on how to use limited resources is critical to maximize profit. This project addresses such a scenario using Linear Programming (LP), a mathematical technique for optimization. The problem is modeled to help determine the optimal number of two products (Product A and Product B) to be produced, considering limitations in labor and material resources. The model aims to maximize total profit without violating resource constraints. It is implemented using Python and the PuLP library.

üß† Problem Background:
Businesses often manufacture multiple products using shared resources. These resources ‚Äî like labor hours and raw materials ‚Äî are limited. Different products generate different profits and consume different amounts of resources. Therefore, it‚Äôs not obvious which combination of products yields the highest overall profit. This is known as the product mix problem, a classic use case of Linear Programming in Operations Research.

üéØ Objective:
The goal of the project is to determine:
How many units of Product A and Product B should be produced
So that the total profit is maximized
While not exceeding the available labor and material

üßæ How the Program Works (Conceptual Steps):
User Input Stage:
The user provides details such as:
Profit earned from each unit of Product A and B
Labor and material requirements per product
Total available labor and material resources

Model Formulation:
The program creates a Linear Programming model with:
Decision variables for the number of units to produce
An objective function to maximize profit
Constraints to ensure labor and material usage don‚Äôt exceed availability

Optimization Solver:
The LP model is passed to an optimization solver that tests combinations of Product A and B to find the one with the highest total profit, while respecting all constraints.

Result Output:
The program displays:
Whether an optimal solution was found
How many units of each product to produce
What is the maximum possible profit

üèÅ Conclusion:
This project is a practical and efficient solution to real-world resource allocation problems. It demonstrates the power of Linear Programming for business optimization and provides a scalable framework that can be extended to complex decision-making scenarios. By using Python and PuLP, we bridge the gap between mathematical modeling and real-world implementation, offering a tool that is both educational and industry-relevant.
